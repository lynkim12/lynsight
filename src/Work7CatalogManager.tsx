              Karrotâ€™s catalog management platform was newly launched in the 1H of 2023. However, due to the limitation of managing and advertising only up to 300 products per catalog, it was challenging to achieve the desired ROAS as it restricted large-scale product advertising. 
              <br/>As a result, we decide to develop the catalog management platform that can handle millions of products.
